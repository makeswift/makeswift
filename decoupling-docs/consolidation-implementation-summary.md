# Consolidation Implementation Summary

This document provides a summary of the consolidation implementation of the Makeswift runtime package.

## Overview

As part of the Makeswift decoupling project, we have reorganized the package structure to align with the documented architecture:

1. Consolidated framework-agnostic (`core`) and React-specific but framework-agnostic (`react`) code into the `@makeswift/runtime` package
2. Created adapter packages for framework-specific code:
   - `@makeswift/next` for Next.js
   - `@makeswift/remix` for Remix

## Implementation Details

```

### Key Components

1. **Core Adapter Interface** (`core/adapter.ts`):
   - Defines the contract for framework-specific adapters
   - Specifies methods for fetch, image, link, head management
   - Includes site version detection

2. **API Client** (`core/api/client.ts`):
   - Framework-agnostic API client for Makeswift services
   - Takes an adapter to handle framework-specific details
   - Handles page data fetching and caching

3. **Element System** (`core/element/types.ts`):
   - Defines element data structures
   - Provides utilities for working with elements
   - Framework-agnostic element representation

4. **React Runtime** (`react/runtime.ts`):
   - React-specific but framework-agnostic runtime
   - Component registration system
   - State management initialization

5. **Element Renderer** (`react/element/renderer.tsx`):
   - Renders elements in React
   - Uses runtime for component lookup
   - Handles child elements recursively

6. **Page Component** (`react/page.tsx`):
   - Renders a Makeswift page from a document or snapshot
   - Uses the element renderer for the root element
   - Framework-agnostic page rendering

### Adapters

Framework-specific adapters implement the adapter interface:

1. **Next.js Adapter** (`@makeswift/next`):
   - Implements Next.js-specific image and link components
   - Handles draft/preview mode with Next.js
   - Manages API routes for Makeswift services

2. **Remix Adapter** (`@makeswift/remix`):
   - Implements Remix-specific image and link components
   - Uses cookies for draft mode
   - Creates resource routes for Makeswift services

## Migration Notes

All code from the separate `/packages/core` and `/packages/react` packages has been migrated to the appropriate subdirectories in `/packages/runtime`. The adapter packages now import from the consolidated runtime package.

The main exports from `@makeswift/runtime` include both the new organization and maintain backward compatibility with existing exports.

## Next Steps

1. Test the consolidated implementation
2. Update adapter packages to use the consolidated runtime
3. Remove the now-redundant packages
4. Update documentation to reflect the final implementation

## Conclusion

This consolidation brings the implementation in line with the documented architecture, providing a cleaner package structure while maintaining backward compatibility. It establishes a solid foundation for framework adapters and provides a clear separation between core, React, and framework-specific code.
