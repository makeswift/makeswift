# makeswift

## 0.3.3-canary.0

### Patch Changes

- 5cfc787: CLI `init` will now prompt user for environment variables when `.env.example` is available in example

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- efec6cd: Fix bug where link command overwrites existing environment variables

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 2a5e096: Add a `link` command.

  The `link` command will allow users with an existing Next.js site to link it to a Makeswift site. This command does nothing in terms of setting up Makeswift pages or using the client inside the Next.js site - that part is expected to already be done upon use of this command.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 66924bc: BREAKING: Removes the capability to integrate existing Next.js apps. This capability was already quite limited and didn't work in most new Next.js apps, including App Router. Instead of supporting a sub par experience we would rather remove the feature and add it back later once we can guarantee proper integration.

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- a64a640: Use `turbo` in prepublishing step to automatically build dependencies as needed

- e94272f: Fix issue with CLI where it wouldn't automatically start your app if used with Bun.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- e30675e: Update the CLI to support Bun.

  Opening the CLI with `bunx makeswift init` now uses Bun for all commands.
  The `--use-bun` flag was also added to force the CLI to use Bun regardless of which package manager it was opened with.

- 461698e: Update the CLI to support the `--use-yarn` flag. This flag makes the CLI use yarn regardless of which package manager it was opened with.
- 0edd60e: Update the CLI to use the package manager it was opened with.

  For `npx makeswift init`, the CLI will use `pnpm`.
  For `pnpm dlx makeswift init`, the CLI will use `pnpm`.
  For `yarn exec makeswift init`, the CLI will use `yarn`.
