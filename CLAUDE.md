Makeswift documentation: https://docs.makeswift.com/developer/app-router/installation

Documentation for project that we're working on: ./decoupling-docs

The packages folder contain the library/runtime that we're building.

The apps folder contains the sample implementation using the runtime.

Always look refer to the library documentation when implementing new things. For example, when implementing react router v7 library, please search the docs on the web to make sure we're using the latest pattern.
