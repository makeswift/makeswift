The docs folder contain all three documentation for the project. The main doc is the decoupling-project, which contains the plan for the decoupling project. The makeswift docs, for the @makeswift/runtime package, and the remix docs for the remix or react router v7 docs.

The packages folder contain the library/runtime that we're building.

The apps folder contains the sample implementation using the runtime.

We're starting the decoupling project. Please read all the docs first: decoupling-docs, makeswift docs, remix docs, look at the implementation in apps, and read through the makeswift runtime package to learn more things.

Keep the core package as @makeswift/runtime, the plan is to create a separate packages: @makeswift/next and
@makeswift/remix.
