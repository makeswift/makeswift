This release introduces support for editable page regions through the new page regions API, which includes two built-in React components, `<Slot>` and `<MakeswiftComponent>`, along with a corresponding Makeswift client method, `getComponentSnapshot`. Check out our new [`editable-regions` example](https://github.com/makeswift/makeswift/tree/main/examples/editable-regions) to learn how to combine these APIs to create a set of dynamic pages with a visually editable header, footer, and a slot for the main content.
