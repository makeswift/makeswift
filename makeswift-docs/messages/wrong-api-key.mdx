title: You are not using the correct API key
---

## What this message means

It seems like you are using a wrong API key in the Makeswift client or API handler.

## Possible ways to fix this

Check that the correct API key is passed to both the Makeswift client and API handler.
If you're using an environment variable for the Makeswift API key, make sure it's set properly.
Our installation guide explains how to set that up:
