title: Your page did not connect to the builder in time.
---

Editing a page in the Makeswift Visual Builder requires your page to establish a
connection with the builder. This message means that your page did not
initialize this connection in time.

## Possible ways to fix this

### Runtime `v0.24` and later

In `v0.24` and later, the connection is automatically initiated by the
`ReactRuntimeProvider`. Make sure you have correctly rendered the
`ReactRuntimeProvider` and are passing a correct value for the `previewMode`
prop. For more details, see our installation guides:

- [App Router installation guide](/developer/app-router/installation)
- [Pages Router installation guide](/developer/pages-router/installation)

### Runtime `v0.23` and earlier

For `v0.23` and earlier, the connection is initiated by the `DraftModeScript` or
`PreviewModeScript` components for App Router and Pages Router, respectively.
This message indicates that these components are likely missing from your page.

#### App Router

Make sure you have added the `DraftModeScript` component to the `<head>` of your
page by rendering it in the root layout.

```diff src/app/layout.tsx
import { draftMode } from "next/headers";
+ import { DraftModeScript } from "@makeswift/runtime/next/server";
import { MakeswiftProvider } from "@/makeswift/provider";
import "@/makeswift/components";

export default async function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
+       <DraftModeScript />
      </head>
      <body>
        <MakeswiftProvider previewMode={(await draftMode()).isEnabled}>
          {children}
        </MakeswiftProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

#### Pages Router

Make sure you have added the `PreviewModeScript` component to the `<Head>` of the
page by extending the custom document.

```diff src/pages/_document.tsx
import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from "next/document";
+ import { PreviewModeScript } from "@makeswift/runtime/next";
import { Document } from "@makeswift/runtime/next/document";

export default class MyDocument extends Document {
  render() {
    return (
      <Html>
        <Head>
+         <PreviewModeScript isPreview={this.props.__NEXT_DATA__.isPreview} />
        </Head>
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}
```
