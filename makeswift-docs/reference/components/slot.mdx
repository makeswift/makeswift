title: "<Slot>"
description: The `<Slot>` component takes a `MakeswiftComponentSnapshot` (returned from calling [getComponentSnapshot](/developer/reference/client/get-component-snapshot)) and renders either a fallback or an editable slot.
---

## Props

1. <ParamField query="snapshot" type="MakeswiftComponentSnapshot" required>
     The Makeswift snapshot to render.
   </ParamField>
2. <ParamField query="label" type="string" required>
     The label of the element in the Visual Builder.
   </ParamField>
3. <ParamField query="fallback" type="React.ReactNode">
     The content to be rendered until the user opts in to making visual edits to
     the editable slot.
     <Note>
       <p>
         If `fallback` is not provided, it will be set to `null` by default. In
         this case, the user will not be able to see the element in the Canvas,
         but they will be able to select it from the Elements Panel.
       </p>
       <p>
         One good use case for this default is with [Dynamic
         Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes);
         for example, product detail pages. If the route renders many pages, it
         might be unreasonable to expect the user to visually edit each one
         before publishing. Because the `null` default will not show any content
         until the user opts in, the user could publish the site without
         affecting any visual content. They could then update and publish
         individual pages as they are ready.
       </p>
     </Note>
   </ParamField>

## Usage in the Visual Builder

The `<Slot>` component will render its fallback by default until the user opts in to visual editing. Visually, this component provides a checkbox property that allows the user to toggle between displaying the fallback and the editable slot itself, including any user generated content within it.

## Example

### Basic Example

The following example creates a home page with a header, a footer, and a main content section that can be edited in the Makeswift Visual Builder using the `<Slot>` component.

```tsx @/app/page.tsx
import { Slot } from "@makeswift/runtime/next";
import { getSiteVersion } from "@makeswift/runtime/next/server";
import { client } from "@/makeswift/client";

export default async function Page() {
  const mainContentSnapshot = await client.getComponentSnapshot(
    `main-content`, //unique identifier of the component rendered on the page
    { siteVersion: await getSiteVersion() }
  );

  return (
    <>
      <header />
      <Slot snapshot={mainContentSnapshot} label={`Main Content`} />
      <footer />
    </>
  );
}
```
