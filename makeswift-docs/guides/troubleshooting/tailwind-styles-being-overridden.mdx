title: Tailwind styles are being overridden
description: Resolve issues with Tailwind v4 or other @layer-based CSS frameworks being overridden by CSS resets
---

## Problem

Starting from [version 4](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-alpha#designed-for-the-modern-web), Tailwind CSS uses `@layer` rules to define its styles.

Makeswift by default includes a CSS reset from [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/).
Because the built-in CSS reset is unlayered, it'll override the Tailwind styles, even if the Tailwind styles are more specific.

From [MDN @layer documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer): "Styles that are not defined in a layer always override styles declared in named and anonymous layers."

## Solution

Disable the built-in CSS reset by setting `enableCssReset={false}` on the [RootStyleRegistry](/developer/reference/components/root-style-registry). If you followed the installation docs, this would be located in your `lib/makeswift/provider.tsx` or `src/makeswift/provider.tsx` file:

```tsx
<RootStyleRegistry enableCssReset={false}>
  {children}
</RootStyleRegistry>
```

Tailwind already ships with [its own reset](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight), so disabling the built-in reset prevents conflicts and preserves Tailwind's styles.
