<Info>
  This guide uses the Netlify dashboard to deploy your Makeswift application.
  Alternatively, you can use the [Netlify
  CLI](https://www.netlify.com/platform/core/cli/).
</Info>

## Prerequisites

You'll need a Makeswift site. If you don't already have one, you can follow the [developer quickstart](/developer/quickstart) or [installation guide](/developer/app-router/installation) to get started. You'll also need:

- A Git repository ([full list of Netlify supported Git providers](https://docs.netlify.com/git/overview/))
- Netlify account ([sign up](https://app.netlify.com/signup))

## Create new project in Netlify

Within the Netlify dashboard, choose **Add new site... > Import an existing project** from the top right of the **Sites** page.

## Connect to Git repo

In the **Connect to Git provider** section, choose your Git repository. If you haven't already, you may need to authorize Netlify to have the correct access to your Git provider.

## Project settings

Netlify will automatically attempt to generate the correct settings for your project. Ensure these settings match your project setup.

### Environment variables

You'll need to include your Makeswift API key which you can find in the Makeswift Visual Builder under **Settings > Host**.

Add your API key to the **Environment Variables** section with a key of `MAKESWIFT_SITE_API_KEY`.

## Deploy

After you finished configuring your settings, click the **Deploy** button. Netlify will build and deploy your Makeswift application. After the build has finished, you should see a success message with a link to your deployed site.
