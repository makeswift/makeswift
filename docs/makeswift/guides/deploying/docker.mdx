## Prerequisites

You'll need a Makeswift site. If you don't already have one, you can follow the [developer quickstart](/developer/quickstart) or [installation guide](/developer/app-router/installation) to get started.

You'll also need to use [Makeswift runtime](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@makeswift/runtime?activeTab=readme) **version `0.23.2` or higher.**

## Deploying

Vercel has already documented how to deploy a Next.js application with Docker. The only change you have to make when deploying your Makeswift site is to your environment variables ([details below](#environment-variables)).

Otherwise, you can follow the [Next.js with Docker](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-docker) documentation.

### Environment variables

You'll need to include the `MAKESWIFT_SITE_API_KEY` environment variable in your Docker build. This will need to be added in the `.env` file that is included in your Docker build, or in the dashboard of your hosting provider.

```bash
MAKESWIFT_SITE_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

Your Makeswift API key can be found in the Makeswift Visual Builder under **Settings > Host**.
