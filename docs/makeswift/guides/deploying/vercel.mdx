<Info>
  This guide uses the Vercel dashboard to deploy your Makeswift application.
  Alternatively, you can use the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli).
</Info>

## Prerequisites

You'll need a Makeswift site. If you don't already have one, you can follow the [developer quickstart](/developer/quickstart) or [installation guide](/developer/app-router/installation) to get started. You'll also need:

- A Git repository ([full list of Vercel supported Git providers](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git))
- Vercel account ([sign up](https://vercel.com/signup))

## Create new project in Vercel

Within the Vercel dashboard, choose **Add New... > Project** from the top right of the **Overview** page.

## Connect to Git repo

In the **Import Git Repository** section, choose your Git repository. If you haven't already, you may need to authorize Vercel to have the correct access to your Git provider.

## Project settings

Vercel will automatically attempt to generate the correct settings for your project. Ensure these settings match your project setup.

### Environment variables

You'll need to include your Makeswift API key which you can find in the Makeswift Visual Builder under **Settings > Host**.

Add your API key to the **Environment Variables** section with a key of `MAKESWIFT_SITE_API_KEY`.

## Deploy

After you finished configuring your settings, click the **Deploy** button. Vercel will build and deploy your Makeswift application. After the build has finished, you should see a success message with a link to your deployed site.
