## Builder isn't loading in Safari

If you're using Safari and the builder isn't loading, it's likely that you're running into issues
with [mixed content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/Security/Mixed_content).

Safari blocks the loading of all mixed-content resources. This means that `https://app.makeswift.com`,
which is loaded via **HTTPS**, can't load `http://localhost:3000`, since it is loaded via **HTTP**.

The solution to this issue is to run your local Next.js app with **HTTPS**. You can do this in Next.js with the following command:

```
next dev --experimental-https
```

> The `--experimental-https` flag requires a Next.js version of `13.5.1` or higher.

For full details, see their [How can I run Next.js on localhost through HTTPS?](https://vercel.com/guides/access-nextjs-localhost-https-certificate-self-signed) guide.

## Builder isn't loading in Brave Browser

If you're using Brave and the builder isn't loading, it's likely you're running into issues with
Brave Shields and its restrictions on `localhost`.

Since the [#463 release](https://github.com/brave/adblock-lists/pull/463), Brave blocks requests to
`localhost` from non-`localhost` documents.

To solve this issue, go to `brave://adblock` and add the following custom filter:

```
@@||localhost^$domain=app.makeswift.com
```

This prevents Brave Shields from blocking `localhost` requests from `app.makeswift.com`.
