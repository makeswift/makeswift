## Rerender During Hydration

Watch the example below to recognize a layout shift caused by a component update during hydration. If your app behaves similarly, follow the steps in this guide.

<Frame>
  <video
    muted
    loop
    playsInline
    controls
    title="Layout shift example"
    className="w-full aspect-video"
    src="/images/developer/guides/troubleshooting/layout-shift/layout-shift.mp4"
  ></video>
</Frame>

### Background

Such shifts happen when a component's props, context, or state change mid-hydration, triggering a Suspense fallback and a visual jump.

One potential cause is a context provider whose value changes between server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR). This can happen if the provider's value is derived from a state or prop that is initialized differently on the server and client.

Here is the summary of how this can happen:
- The page is server-side rendered (SSR).
- The server sends the HTML to the client, and React begins hydration.
- While hydration is in progress, the client side receives a new update.
- This update interrupts hydration, causing React to discard the in-progress hydration and re-render the components on the client with the updated session value.
- While client side re-rendering is happening, React replaces the server rendered content with a client side fallback found in a closest `Suspense` boundary. The fallback happens to be `null` in this case. This effectively causes the layout shift.

According to the React team's [comment](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/24476#issuecomment-1127800350) in a GitHub issue, this is expected behavior and not considered a bug.

<Info>
Makeswift runtime library wraps all page components in a `Suspense` boundary when serving a page.

<Note>
React used to log a warning for this situation when using the Next.js Pages Router (though the App Router suppressed it). That warning [was removed](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/25692) in later versions of React 18 and in React 19.

### Troubleshooting Steps

#### 1. Reproduce the Shift

- Load your page fresh (SSR) and look for sudden collapses or reflows. E.g., headers, nav menus, or sections disappearing briefly—then snapping into place.
- In Chrome DevTools → **Performance**, you'll see “layout-shift” entries aligned with two render passes.

#### 2. Record with React DevTools Profiler

- Open the **Profiler**, start recording, then reload the page.
- Stop recording after the shift. In the flame chart, find two consecutive renders of the same component (hydration then update).

#### 3. Pinpoint the Problematic Update

- Examine which props, context values, or state differ between those renders.
- Common culprits:
  - Context providers whose value identity changes
  - State initialized differently on client vs. server
  - Data fetched in a `useEffect` (runs post-hydration)

#### 4. Isolate the Component

- Temporarily comment out or disable the suspected update (e.g., remove the provider or delay the state change).
- Confirm that the shift disappears when that update is skipped.

#### 5. Apply a Permanent Fix

- **Match SSR & Client:** Ensure initial props/state are identical. For example, compute or fetch values during SSR so the client sees the same markup.
- **Memoize Values:** Wrap dynamic context or prop values in [`useMemo`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo) to avoid identity changes during hydration.
- **Defer Non-Critical Updates:** Use React's [`startTransition`](https://react.dev/reference/react/startTransition) to mark updates as non-urgent, preventing fallback rendering.

#### 6. Verify the Resolution

- Re-run your Profiler trace: you should now see only one render with no fallback UI invoked during hydration.
- Confirm that no “layout-shift” entries align with any component updates.

By following this reproduce → profile → isolate → fix workflow, you'll eliminate jumps caused by component updates during React hydration.
