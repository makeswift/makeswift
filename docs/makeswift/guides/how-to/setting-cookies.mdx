title: "Setting Cookies"
description: Configuring cookies for use within the Makeswift Visual Builder
---

If your site relies on setting/reading cookies, you may experience some issues
when interacting with your site within the Makeswift Visual Builder. This is
because our builder loads your site within an `iframe`, so any cookies your site
attempts to set are considered as [third-party
cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Guides/Third-party_cookies).

In order for your site to be able to set cookies that are compatible with the
Makeswift Visual Builder, you may need to include certain attributes.

## Minimum Attributes

In order for a third-party cookie to be set, you'll need to specify the
`SameSite=None;` and `Secure;`
[attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#controlling_third-party_cookies_with_samesite)
on your cookie.

For example, let's say your site attempts to set a cookie client-side using
`document.cookie`:

```typescript
document.cookie = "myCookie=1234;";
```

While this may work on your live site, it will not work in the builder because
of the third-party restrictions. Let's update this cookie to use
`SameSite=None;` and `Secure;`:

```typescript
document.cookie = "myCookie=1234; SameSite=None; Secure;";
```

This will now be able to be set in most browsers, assuming the user has the
appropriate browser settings.

Similarly, you may be setting cookies in a server response using the
`Set-Cookie` header. For example, you may be using the [`cookies()`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies) API from
Next.js:

```typescript
import { cookies } from "next/headers";

export async function setCustomCookies() {
  const cookieStore = await cookies();
  cookieStore.set({
    name: "myCookie",
    value: "1234",
  });
}
```

Again, the same attributes are necessary here:

```typescript
import { cookies } from "next/headers";

export async function setCustomCookies() {
  const cookieStore = await cookies();
  cookieStore.set({
    name: "myCookie",
    value: "1234",
    // Adding cross-site attribute below
    sameSite: "none",
    secure: true,
  });
}
```

If you're setting a raw `Set-Cookie` header string on your response header, you
can follow the same conventions as the client-side cookie string.

## Partitioned Cookies (CHIPS)

Nearly all major browsers have plans to fully deprecate third-party cookies in
the near future. As a workaround, the [**Cookies Having Independent Partitioned
State**
(CHIPS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Guides/Privacy_sandbox/Partitioned_cookies)
spec was introduced. Partitioned cookies are keyed by both the domain of the
third-party site that set them and the top-level site in which they were set. In
Makeswift, your site is the one setting the cookie, and the top-level site would
be the Visual Builder, `app.makeswift.com`. This means that any cookies set by
your site within the builder are scoped to the builder!

To achieve this functionality, simply add a `Partitioned;` attribute whenever
you set your cookies. Using our client-side example from above:

```typescript
document.cookie = "myCookie=1234; SameSite=None; Secure; Partitioned;";
```

And our Next.js `cookies()` example:

```typescript
import { cookies } from "next/headers";

export async function setCustomCookies() {
  const cookieStore = await cookies();
  cookieStore.set({
    name: "myCookie",
    value: "1234",
    sameSite: "none",
    secure: true,
    partitioned: true,
    // ^^^ Cookie will now be partitioned when set on the client
  });
}
```

Partitioned cookies [are currently
supported](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Guides/Privacy_sandbox/Partitioned_cookies#browser_compatibility)
by Chrome and Firefox. Safari support is still in development.

### Safari

Since Safari still does not currently support partitioned cookies, the
recommended way to have full cookie functionality within the builder is to
[follow our guide](/product/troubleshooting/cookies#safari) to disable
cross-site tracking prevention when using our editor.

## Cookies by other libraries

It's also possible that you're using an external package that sets its own
cookies. For example, middleware from the [`next-intl`](https://next-intl.dev/docs/routing/middleware) package will attempt to set
cookies for detected locales. For such cases, we recommend checking the docs of
these tools to see if they allow for cookie attribute configuration. Continuing
the `next-intl` example, we see that their [APIs offer
customization](https://next-intl.dev/docs/routing#locale-cookie) of their locale
detection cookie.

If the third-party package you're using does not permit modifying cookie
attributes, you may still be able to patch them retroactively using the Next.js
`cookies()` API (if the cookies are set server-side), or by manually writing
cookies with the appropriate attributes client-side. Whenever you make changes
to how external packages set cookies, make sure to test that the cookie
attribute changes don't impact the security or functionality of your cookies on
your live site.
