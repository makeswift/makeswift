title: Upgrading to 0.14.0
---

If you haven't upgraded to `0.13.0` please read the [upgrading guide](/developer/upgrading/0.13.0).

### Update the API handler file

Find your API handler at `/pages/api/[...makeswift].ts`

```js
-- import { MakeswiftApiHandler } from "@makeswift/runtime/next"
++ import { MakeswiftApiHandler } from "@makeswift/runtime/next/server"

export default MakeswiftApiHandler(process.env.MAKESWIFT_SITE_API_KEY)
```

### Replace deprecated functions from `0.2.0`

These exported functions from `@makeswift/runtime/next` were deprecated:

- `getStaticPaths`
- `getStaticProps`
- `getServerSideProps`

To replace these functions, please follow the [manual installation](/developer/pages-router/installation) guide.

Here is the link to the [official release notes](https://github.com/makeswift/makeswift/releases/tag/%40makeswift%2Fruntime%400.14.0).
