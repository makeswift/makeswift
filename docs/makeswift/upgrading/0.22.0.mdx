title: Upgrading to 0.22.0
---

If you haven't upgraded to `0.21.0` please read the [upgrading guide](/developer/upgrading/0.21.0).

`v0.22.0` of the runtime introduces some performance improvements to internal
runtime rendering functions.

## Breaking Changes

### `ReactNode[]` props

Previously, registered components that accepted a list of `ReactNode`s, like
the example `Slots` component below, could render the list by simply
interpolating its value in JSX:

```typescript
export const Slots = forwardRef(function Slots(
  { slots }: { slots: ReactNode[] },
  ref: Ref<HTMLDivElement>,
) {
  return (
    <div ref={ref}>{slots}</div>
    //             ^^^^^^^
  )
})

runtime.registerComponent(Slots, {
  type: '@acme/list-of-slots',
  label: 'Slots',
  props: {
    slots: List({ label: 'Slots', type: Slot() }),
  },
})
```

This worked because the `slots` value was never actually passed as a _list_ of
`ReactNode`s. Instead, it was passed as a single `ReactNode` representing an
internal component rendering the list as a recursive
[cons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons)-like structure.

If you have registered components that expect a list of `ReactNode`s and rely
on this undocumented behavior, you must update your code to wrap each node in
a `React.Fragment` with a corresponding key:

```diff
export const Slots = forwardRef(function Slots(
  { slots }: { slots: ReactNode[] },
  ref: Ref<HTMLDivElement>,
) {
  return (
-    <div ref={ref}>{slots}</div>
+    <div ref={ref}>{slots.map((slot, i) => (<Fragment key={i}>{slot}</Fragment>))}</div>
  )
})
```
