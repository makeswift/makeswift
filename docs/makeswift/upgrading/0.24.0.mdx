title: Upgrading to 0.24.0
---

If you haven't yet upgraded to `0.23.0`, please review the [0.23.0 upgrade guide](/developer/upgrading/0.23.0) first.

Version `0.24.0` of the runtime revises the handling of draft and preview modes, as well as the default behavior of localized pages.

Refer to the [official release notes](https://github.com/makeswift/makeswift/releases/tag/%40makeswift/runtime%400.24.0)
for the full list of changes.

## Breaking Changes

### Removed `<DraftModeScript />` and `<PreviewModeScript />`

The `<DraftModeScript />` and `<PreviewModeScript />` components are no longer
necessary to edit your pages within the Makeswift Visual Builder and have been
removed from the runtime. You can safely remove any imports and usages of these
components from your code.

#### App Router

```diff src/app/layout.tsx
import { draftMode } from "next/headers";
- import { DraftModeScript } from "@makeswift/runtime/next/server";
import { MakeswiftProvider } from "@/makeswift/provider";
import "@/makeswift/components";

export default async function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
-      <head>
-         <DraftModeScript />
-       </head>
      <body>
        <MakeswiftProvider previewMode={(await draftMode()).isEnabled}>
          {children}
        </MakeswiftProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```



#### Pages Router

```diff src/pages/_document.tsx
import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from "next/document";
- import { PreviewModeScript } from "@makeswift/runtime/next";
import { Document } from "@makeswift/runtime/next/document";

export default class MyDocument extends Document {
  render() {
    return (
      <Html>
        <Head>
-          <PreviewModeScript isPreview={this.props.__NEXT_DATA__.isPreview} />
        </Head>
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}
```

### Removed `MAKESWIFT_DRAFT_MODE_PROXY_FORCE_HTTP` environment variable

If your Makeswift site is [deployed with Docker](/developer/guides/deploying/docker), the
`MAKESWIFT_DRAFT_MODE_PROXY_FORCE_HTTP` environment variable is no longer
used or necessary. You can safely remove it from your Docker build.


## Localized pages are online by default

Localized pages now automatically fall back to the base locale by default and are no longer 
silently created when navigated to in the builder. To create a localized page, users must 
take explicit action in the builder.

Localized pages explicitly marked as Offline will remain offline.

You can disable fallback behavior on a per-page basis by passing `allowLocaleFallback: false` 
to the `client.getPageSnapshot` call:

```typescript
const snapshot = await client.getPageSnapshot(path, {
  siteVersion: await getSiteVersion(),
  locale,
  allowLocaleFallback: false,
});
```
