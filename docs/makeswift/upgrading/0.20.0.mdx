title: Upgrading to 0.20.0
---

If you haven't upgraded to `0.19.0` please read the [upgrading guide](/developer/upgrading/0.19.0).

`v0.20.0` of the runtime introduces several changes to the internals of the
runtime, but the API changes are limited to unique cases when registering
components that should not affect most users:

1.  Attempting to create a control with arbitrary configuration options will now
    result in a TypeScript compilation error:

    ```typescript
    import { Number } from "@makeswift/runtime/controls";
    
    const num = Number({ foo: "bar" }); // TS error, `foo` is not a valid `Number` param
    ```

    Prior to this version, the arbitrary options were silently ignored.

2.  The `Select` control now requires `options` to be a readonly array with at
    least one entry. If you are not defining your options inline, you may need
    to declare the options `as const`.

    ```typescript
    import { Select } from "@makeswift/runtime/controls";

    const sel = Select({
      label: "Select",
      options: [], // TS error, non-empty array is required
    });
    ```

    Previously, the `options` array was allowed to be empty.

Additionally, several undocumented internal types and functions are no longer
being exported from the package, as they were not intended for our public API.

Lastly, this version of the runtime now validates control configuration at
runtime. If you were using the runtime without TypeScript, you may see errors in
the console if you pass invalid options to a control. We recommend reading our
[controls documentation](/developer/reference/controls) to ensure proper usage,
or if possible, using TypeScript to catch these errors ahead of time.
