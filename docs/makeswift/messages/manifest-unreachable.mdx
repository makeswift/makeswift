title: The host manifest is unreachable
---

## What this message means

Makeswift uses a host manifest to fetch metadata about your site. This metadata is used by the builder to determine
what URL to use to route pages, what version of the runtime is running in the host, and what features are available
in the host. If the host manifest is unreachable, the pages in the builder will not load properly.

## Possible ways to fix this

Here is a list of things to check to make sure the host manifest is reachable

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check that your Next.js app is running">
    Makeswift can only fetch the host manifest if your Next.js app is running. Make sure your Next.js app is running.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check that the host URL is correct in the Makeswift host settings">
    If your Next.js app is running, check that the host URL including the host
    name and port are correct in the Makeswift host settings. Update the host URL
    if necessary.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Check that your API key is passed to the Makeswift API handler">
    Makeswift fetches the manifest from an API handler in your Next.js app.
    If you're using an environment variable for the Makeswift API key, make sure it's set properly.

  <Step title="Check that the Makeswift API handler is set up">
    Makeswift fetches the manifest from an API handler in your Next.js app. Make sure the API handler is set up correctly.
