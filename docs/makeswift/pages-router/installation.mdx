The fastest way to get started with Makeswift on a new Next.js project is to follow the
[quickstart](/developer/quickstart) guide. If you have an existing Next.js application
or want to set things up yourself, continue with the rest of this guide.

## Project Setup

<ProjectSetup />

## Getting started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your Next.js project">
    First, open your Next.js project. If you don't already have one, head over to
    the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation)
    documentation to get one set up. If you do have one, please verify you are
    using [Next.js 13.4](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12) or a later version.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install dependencies">
  Install the `@makeswift/runtime` package. This package contains all of the necessary
  code to integrate Makeswift into your Next.js app.

```bash
npm install @makeswift/runtime
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add API key to environment variables">
  
Requesting data through the `Makeswift` client requires a site API key from Makeswift. In the Makeswift builder, go to **Settings > Host** and copy the API key for the site.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/site-api-key.gif" alt="How to get the site API key" />
</Frame>

Once the API key is in your clipboard, open your [`.env.local`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables) file and paste the snippet below.

```sh
MAKESWIFT_SITE_API_KEY=paste-your-api-key-here
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Makeswift runtime">
  
Create the Makeswift [runtime](/developer/reference/runtime/constructor) file in `src/makeswift`.

<RuntimeExample />

</Step>
<Step title="Add Makeswift client">
  
Create the Makeswift [client](/developer/reference/client/constructor) file in `src/makeswift`.

<ClientExample />

</Step>
  <Step title="Add the Makeswift API handler">
  
Similar to [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/), Makeswift uses an API handler to communicate with your Next.js app. Create the file `src/pages/api/makeswift/[...makeswift].ts`.

<Note>
  It is important this file has that exact name and path. The extension can be
  `.js` or `.ts`.
</Note>

<ApiHandlerExample />

This API route adds support for
[preview mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/preview-mode),
[on-demand revalidation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration#on-demand-revalidation),
and other features that make Makeswift work seamlessly with your Next.js app.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Next.js plugin">
  
Next.js plugins are configured in the project's next.config.js file by wrapping `nextConfig`. The Makeswift Next.js plugin whitelists Makeswift image domains and sets up rewrites to enable preview mode in the Makeswift builder.

<NextConfigExample />

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up a custom Document">
  
The Makeswift [custom Document](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-document) handles styles during server-side rendering and using [Preview Mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/preview-mode) when opening your pages in the Makeswift builder.

Create the file `src/pages/_document.ts` and export `Document` from `@makeswift/runtime/next/document`:

<DocumentExample />

If you already have a `_document.ts`, you can extend the `Document` from `@makeswift/runtime/next/document` instead.

<Accordion title="Example of extending an existing document">
```tsx src/pages/_document.tsx
import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from "next/document";
import { Document } from "@makeswift/runtime/next/document";

export default class MyDocument extends Document {
  render() {
    return (
      <Html>
        <Head />
        <body>
          <Main />
          {/* Your custom code here */}
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}
```
</Accordion>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Register components with Makeswift">
  
Create a file for registered components called `src/makeswift/components.tsx`. In this example, only one component is registered. However, as you register more components, we recommend creating separate files for each component and rolling up the imports in the `src/makeswift/components.ts` file. Learn more about [registering components](/developer/reference/runtime/register-component).

<ComponentsExample />

  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide the runtime to Custom App">

If you don't have a [Custom App](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app) you'll need to create one. Then wrap your Custom App with the Makeswift `ReactRuntimeProvider` component.

<PagesAppExample />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a route for Makeswift pages">
  
Create an [optional catch-all route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#optional-catch-all-segments) named `[[...path]].tsx`. You will use this route to fetch page snapshots from the `Makeswift` client and render them using the [`Page`](/developer/reference/components/page) component.

<PagesCatchAllExample />

**Important notes**:

1. If you already have a root `index.tsx` file inside of the `pages` directory and you'd like to manage that page in code (not in Makeswift), you will need to name the file `[...path].tsx` instead of `[[...path]].tsx`. Otherwise, you'll need to delete it to let the root page be managed in Makeswift. For more information about the differences between catch-all and optional catch-all segments, refer to the Next.js [Catch-all segments](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments) documentation.

2. The filename defines the `path` param. For example, if the filename is `[[...slug]].tsx` instead of `[[...path]].tsx`, then the param name is `slug`. Because this is an optional catch-all route, there are no params when visiting the index (i.e., `/`) path. The `path` param defaults to an empty array.

3. [`fallback: 'blocking'`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths#fallback-blocking) is used here so that your Next.js app doesn't need to be re-deployed whenever a new Makeswift page is created.

With this setup, your pages will be rendered using
[incremental static regeneration](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration).
A `revalidate` field isn't added to the returned value of `getStaticProps` because
Makeswift pages are automatically revalidated using
[on-demand revalidation](https://nextjs.org/basic-features/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration#on-demand-revalidation)
by leveraging the Makeswift API handler.

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start the local dev server">
  
Run the local development script. This will start the Next.js app at `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
npm run dev
```

If port `3000` is already in use, Next.js will try port `3001`, then `3002`, and so forth until it finds an
unused port.

<Note>Take note of this port for the next step.</Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your app's URL to Makeswift">
  
Finally, open the Makeswift builder, navigate to **Settings > Host**, and add your app's URL. If you haven't changed anything in the example and the server is running on port `3000`, the app's URL should be
`http://localhost:3000`.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/host-url.gif" alt="How to update the host url" />
</Frame>

When you're ready to deploy, set up a separate site and use your deployment URL
instead of `http://localhost:3000`. You can keep this site for local development.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start building">
  
Great job! You should be able to create a page in Makeswift and start dropping in registered
components from the left toolbar.

    src="/images/hello-world-registered.png"
    alt="Hello world component registered"
  />
